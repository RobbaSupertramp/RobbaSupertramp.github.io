<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
  
  
  <p>Concept art for a supposed "unannounced Crytek triple-A project" appeared online, supposedly showing the next game from the studio behind <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/crysis/4-announcement">Crysis 4</a> and Hunt: Showdown - which looks a lot like a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-space-games">space game,</a> and more than that, a mix of Starfield and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Other than the still-popular Hunt: Showdown, the only upcoming game announced by Crytek is Crysis 4, which was revealed earlier this year and was recently confirmed as being led by an <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/crysis/4-lead-director">ex-Hitman and Far Cry 3 developer</a>. Unless the team is going in a far more sci-fi direction, some purported leaked artwork may be the first at another new Crytek game.</p>
<p>As posted on <a href="https://www.behance.net/anilgunduz/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Behance</a> by environmental concept artist An?l G�nd�z (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/v0qsdg/comment/iamq7yj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>), four pieces of their futuristic artwork are stated to be part of the "project vision" for an "unannounced Crytek triple-A project". The first shows a man in a spacesuit looking at a giant in a tube, the second a Cyberpunk 2077-style city, and the last two show very <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/starfield/concept-art">Starfield-like colonies</a> in outer space.</p>

The monstrous machine resembles Crytek's iconic helmet, clad with a menacingly red visor and an open panel design.</p>
<p>Created by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmods/comments/uo8gbf/maximum_rig_crysis_nanosuit_mod/">Specialist_Yak9659</a>, the custom <strong>Crysis gaming PC</strong> uses a Fractal Define S2 at its core, with various 3D printed parts helping the PC case cosplay a CELL Assault Operative. The modder says they used "hot air and hands" to mould some pieces of the build into shape, and that the project took five days to complete.</p>
<p>At the heart of this Crysis rig is an Intel Alder Lake i7-12600k, Corsair Vengeance Pro DDR4 <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-gaming-ram">gaming RAM</a>, and a founders edition Nvidia RTX 3090. As you'd perhaps expect, the PC's innards are drenched in RGB, thanks to a Byski GPU watercooler and Deepcool RF120 fans. Extra details like external illuminated piping help emphasise the ambitions of this build, while lettering across the helmet hammers home the fact this is a Crytek inspired case. Y'know, just in case you think this is just an angry-looking Halo Spartan or something.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, developer Crytek <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/crysis/4-announcement">finally confirmed a long-standing rumour</a> by admitting that a new Crysis game was in development, over nine years after the release of Crysis 3. The developer stated that the sequel was still only "in the early stages" and that it would be "a while yet" before fans heard anything about it.</p>
<p>Well, we now know at least one major piece of information, as Crytek revealed today that Mattias Engstr�m - formerly of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,285196/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IO Interactive and Ubisoft</a> - is the new Crysis 4 game director. Engstr�m was previously the director of Hitman 3, one of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-stealth-games-pc">the best stealth games on PC</a>, so hopefully that'll mean the new Crysis game's sneaky side will be satisfying. Before that, he was also a level designer on Hitman and Hitman 2 before being tasked to lead the most recent game - which <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman-3/review">clearly worked out for the best</a>.</p>

Developer Crytek has announced the news in a blog post accompanied by a brief but atmospheric teaser trailer, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>"It's something you have been asking us for a long time, so it's now finally time to confirm - yes, a new Crysis game is happening!" the studio reveals in the <a href="https://www.crysis.com/blog/new-crysis-game-confirmed">blog post</a>. Crytek explains that the game isn't too far along just yet, being "in the early stages of development", so it's going to be "a while yet" before we see it arrive, but it should be exciting news for fans of the popular <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters">FPS game</a> series. "We are so pleased and excited to bring this news to you, and we really can't wait to reveal more details about what lies ahead," the blog adds.</p>
<p>"As development progresses we will release more details when we can. But in the meantime, know that our dedicated and talented team is working hard to bring you a truly next-gen shooter."</p>

Its sequels never quite hit the same highs, but it looks like another shot is coming - a series of teasers are offering fresh hope that a new Crysis game is coming.</p>
<p>Today, the official Crysis account on Twitter has sent out a message that simply says "receiving data". It's the first tweet from the account in nearly four years - the profile description still proudly announces that Crysis 3 is "available now for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3". We'll be awaiting further word on what this teaser means, but it's joining a host of other recent hints.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, the <a href="https://www.crysis.com/">official website</a> for Crysis got an update, and it now features Nomad - the protagonist of the original game - standing aboard what very much looks like the same sort of plane that opens Crysis 1. The source code for the site update also included an 'April Fool' tag, but it's starting to look like this was more than a seasonal prank.</p>

Crysis is a first-person stealth playground and a staggering spectacle, but new tech wizardry doesn&rsquo;t justify the new price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/crysis">Crysis</a></p>
<p> was always about more than its graphics. Crysis was and is a first-person stealth playground, with destructible buildings, clever enemies, and a set of flexible superpowers with which to make one collide with the other. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/crysis-remastered">Crysis Remastered</a> is that game again, with new graphical bells and whistles you probably can&rsquo;t use, and a substantially higher price than the original game costs now.</p>

<p> is out and yes, you can probably run it. You will need to buy it though, because that&rsquo;s how these things work. The remaster includes visual updates like 8k resolution textures and ray-traced reflections for those of you willing to put your systems through their paces.

<p>Famed for its steep requirements and melting PCs the world over, the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/crysis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crysis</a> was arguably one of the most important PC games of its day when it first came out in 2007. Not only did it push current PCs to their limits, but it also became a touchstone for the avid benchmarkers in the years that followed. Whenever you built a new PC, the joke was always, &ldquo;But can it run Crysis?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now, that joke is probably going to become, &ldquo;But can it run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game/crysis-remastered" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crysis Remastered</a>?&rdquo;, which arrives on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/crysis-remastered/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> tomorrow, September 18th. With support for 8K textures, software-driven ray tracing, real-time reflections and loads more, developer Crytek and partner Saber Interactive have given the 2007 original quite the new coat of graphical paint � and I got to speak with Crysis Remastered&rsquo;s project lead Steffen Halbig ahead of the game&rsquo;s launch to talk all about it. We chat about everything from what kind of performance you can expect from its official PC requirements, to how their software-based ray tracing works, and why there&rsquo;s currently no system on the planet that can max out its aptly-named &ldquo;Can It Run Crysis?&rdquo; mode. </p>

Seven years later, the official Crysis Twitter account is broadcasting signs of life.</p><p> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/04/13/crytek-are-booting-up-something-crysis-related/#more-817765" class="more-link"><span aria-label="Continue reading Crytek are booting up something Crysis related">(more&hellip;)</span></a></p>

<p>The best shooters endure. While other genres warp beyond recognition, there is something solid about the first-person shooter that makes it as dependable as a nice big AK-47. Maybe it   s the gung-ho simplicity &#8211; look down a barrel and pull the trigger. It&#8217;s as fun to fire a double-barrelled shotgun from an early 90s FPS as the slick shotties of today. For that reason, this list runs the gamut from genre classics to those released in the last year. There&#8217;s bound to be something for you in this, our list of the best 50 FPS games on PC. Let   s lock and/or load.</p>

We recently looked at a stunning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jD0mELZPD8" target="_blank">path traced version of Minecraft</a>, but what if RT techniques could be applied to all DirectX9 and DirectX11 games? And what happens if we apply that new technology to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2018-why-crysis-still-melts-the-fastest-gaming-pcs-10-years-later" target="_blank">classic PC mangler, Crysis</a>? Watch the video embedded on this page and you'll see that it works to a transformative degree - albeit with limitations.</p><p>It's all because of a new extension currently in development for the powerful post-process injection tool, <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank">Reshade</a>, created by modding veteran and Nvidia Ancel contributor, Pascal Gilcher. Reshade works by hooking into DirectX, accessing the data contained in the depth and colour buffers to accomplish a range of post-process effects, including SMAA anti-aliasing, screen-space reflections, depth of field and colour tints to name but a few. A new ray tracing feature is now available in alpha builds - and strictly speaking, this adds a new layer of global illumination derived from path tracing. It's not a full fat implementation as we saw in Minecraft, but it can have a transformative effect - particularly on titles like the original Crysis, created at a time when the way games were lit was somewhat na  ve compared to modern day implementations.</p><p>Crysis was a pioneer for screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) which uses data from the depth buffer to add shade to the nooks and crannies on-screen. The technique has evolved constantly over the last decade, but path traced global illumination can take this to the next level: Reshade beams out three rays per pixel in calculating shade and light bounce - giving a new layer of accuracy and depth to the way the scene is lit. Take a look at the video below and you'll see a number of A to B comparisons that reveal a stark difference. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-crysis-ray-tracing-co-op-extreme-modding">Read more</a></p>,date=1557148054,feedlabel=Eurogamer,feedname=eurogamer,gid=2404270358336492221,isExternalUrl=true,title=Crysis as you've never seen it before - with ray traced lighting and co-op play,url=https://steamstore-a.akamaihd.net/news/externalpost/eurogamer/2404270358336492221,additionalProperties={appid=17300, feed_type=0}], com.lukaspradel.steamapi.data.json.appnews.Newsitem@4f3bbf68[author=contact@rockpapershotgun.com (Alec Meer),contents=<p><img src="https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2018/07/crysis.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="428" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-567737" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Will it run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/crysis/">Crysis</a>?&#8221; was an oft-expressed anxiety of mid-noughties PC gaming, but here in the chaotic end-times of 2018 we&#8217;re faced with a new one: &#8220;Crysis can&#8217;t run Crysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come October, there&#8217;ll be no more multiplayer nanosuit shenanigans: Crytek are shutting the online component of Crysis down, apparently because the playerbase is just too dang small to make life support worthwhile. Singleplayer isn&#8217;t going anywhere, you&#8217;ll be glad to hear, but still: it&#8217;s sad when something dies.<br />

<p>Three fallacies I&#8217;m occasionally guilty of believing: </p>
<p>1) The Oculus Rift does not involve any of the physicality of the HTC Vive<br />
2) VR gaming is riding a cart to minigame hell<br />
3) There&#8217;s a ceiling on how good VR games can look</p>

<p>Global illumination.<br />
Volumetric clouds.<br />
Sub-surface scattering.</p>
<p>These are words that make me hot. </p>
<p>But I know this feeling is forbidden. I should care about <em>games</em>, not the empty pursuit of photorealism. But oh my, it   s so exciting, and not empty. In fact, I think that right now photorealism is becoming crucial to games, and that we should celebrate it.</p>

<p>When later entries in a series go wrong, the disappointment tends not to blight the original people liked so much. Unfortunately <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/crysis/">Crysis</a> [<a href="http://crysis.com/">official site</a>] couldn&#8217;t maintain the things people liked about it for even its own running time.

<p>Hello youse!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re off the back of a string of five reviews, so it&#8217;s time for a NEWS UPDATE. Let&#8217;s call this the NEWS UPDATE OF MAY, or the MAY NEWS UPDATE. Of board games, obviously. And you might be thinking &#8211;    Well, Rab, you just did a news update last month, called the April News Update or something. Is there even more news about daft board games already?    And I&#8217;m all like that &#8211;    Well, yes.   </p>
