  <p>A game most famous for its beautiful visuals can be beamed directly into your eyeballs, thanks to some clever modding for the Oculus Rift. Modder Nathan Andrews, who previously worked on Half-Life and Black Mesa mods for the VR device, has started cracking into the CryEngine and produced a neat proof-of-concept video to prove it.</p><p><shack:readmore caption="Read more: Crysis, Crysis Wars, and CryEngine 3 supported »" /></p><p><a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/02/26/crysis-gets-vr-mod-beam-maximum-graphics-directly-into-your-face/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> reports that the mod is incomplete, as it lacks things like a crosshair and iron-sights. But he has the mod up and running, at least, in both <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/game/crysis">Crysis</a> and <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/game/crysis-wars">Crysis Wars</a>. He also mentioned that he's ported the mod to CryEngine 3 "if anyone is interested in building a game from the ground up with VR support."</p><p>We're probably witnessing the way humanity ends. When aliens are picking over our bodies and wondering how we died, they'll discover it wasn't famine or nuclear war. We all just had VR equipment strapped to our heads and no reason to leave our picturesque tropical islands. Still, what a way to go.</p><p><iframe width="620" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TJx21yuCi7E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Three years after <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/61750/mechwarrior-living-legends-crysis-mod">launching</a>, stompy robot <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/game/crysis">Crysis</a> mod MechWarrior: Living Legends has released its very final version. The gang at Wandering Samurai Studios still have more they'd like to do but, alas, their <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/49121/mechwarrior-crysis-mod-given-legal">license</a> to use the MechWarrior property is up. So, <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/file/33992/crysis-wars-mechwarrior-living-legends-final-release-patch-070">download Living Legends 0.7.0</a> and see it out with a plasma blast.</p><p><shack:readmore caption="Read more: "We present to you this culmination of 6 years of work" »" /></p><p>"Over the years, we�??ve strived to create the greatest, most innovative Battletech/MechWarrior game ever conceived. We feel our efforts re-inspired faith in the MechWarrior IP and paved the way to show that hard work and perseverance can bring anything to life given enough blood, sweat, and tears," project director 'Defender' wrote in the <a href="http://www.mechlivinglegends.net/2013-01/mechwarrior-living-legends-final-release-0-7-0/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. "Created by fans, for fans, we present to you this culmination of 6 years of work and whatever else we could slap together in time to release this final update to you; our community."</p><p>Patch 0.7.0 brings changes including new mechs and tanks, new HUDs, bug fixes, and balance tweaks. Wandering Samurai also gave a list of features which have been started but shall never be finished now that it's forced to stop. We won't see 16 maps, heaps of mechs of vehicles, several game modes, replacement sounds for all the Crysis assets, and more.</p><p>"As Developers and Staff of Wandering Samurai Studios, we are, as of this point, no longer allowed to create future content based on the MechWarrior IP due to legal obligations on behalf of various rights holders," Defender wrote. "These rights holders own the Legally Binding, Non-Transferrable, Non-Commercial License Agreement with Microsoft and as of 2013 will no longer officially support the MechWarrior: Living Legends division of Wandering Samurai Studios."</p><p>Even though MechWarrior was a dormant franchise at the time, it was still a surprise when then-rightsholder Microsoft gave Wandering Samurai the license. Now that MechWarrior is getting big again and actually making money, the new owners are probably looking to lock it down. Living Legends stomps similar ground to <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/game/mechwarrior-online">MechWarrior Online</a>, <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/game/mechwarrior-tactics">MechWarrior Tactics</a> is also on the horizon, and MWO developer Piranha is <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/piranha-wants-single-player-mechwarrior-but-its-tough/" target="_blank">interested</a> in making a single-player MW game too.</p>

Available to preview at GDC was the latest version of Crytek's CryEngine 3. It joins Epic's next generation tech, and Battlefield 3 on the list of 'stuff you should probably consider upgrading for. No sign of a game it's associated with just yet, but that funky looking trike suggests a military based shooter set sometime in the near future. Possibly with aliens.

                    A new trailer from Crytek showcases some of the fun you'll be having in Crysis 2's multiplayer. You can watch it after the jump. <br />
<br />
The footage shows off some death match and Crash Site action (where players must defend drop pods from the opposing team). It does a good job of demonstrating the Nanosuit's various abilities, including stealth kills and kicking cars over. It is, naturally, all very pretty. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for us PC crowd, the final message is a bit of a kick in the teeth: "Xbox 360 exclusive multiplayer demo begins January 25th". Nice one, Crytek. Nice one. <br />
